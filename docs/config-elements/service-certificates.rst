``<serviceCertificates>`` Element
=================================
This is an **optional** child element of the :doc:`sustainsys.saml2 <sustainsys-saml2>` element.

Specifies the certificate(s) that the service provider uses for encrypted assertions (and for signed requests, once 
that feature is added). If neither of those features are used, this element can be ommitted.

The public key(s) will be exposed in the metadata and the private key(s) will be used during decryption/signing.

Individual certificates are added via an ``<add>`` element, so the resulting XML will be similar to the following:

.. code-block:: xml

    <serviceCertificates>
        <add use="" status="" metadataPublishOverride="" />
        <add use="" status="" metadataPublishOverride="" />
        ...
    </serviceCertificates>

Attributes
----------
``use``
    Indicates how the certificate will be used.  Options are:

    * ``Signing``
    * ``Encryption``
    * ``Both`` (default)

``status``
    Indicates whether the certificate is a current or future certificate -- used in key rollover scenarios.  Options are:

    * ``Current`` (default)
    * ``Future``

``metadataPublishOverride``
    By default the certificate will be used and published by the rules shown in the table below.  To 
    override this behavior choose one of the following options for this attribute:

    * ``None`` (Default) - published according to the rules in the table below.
    * ``PublishUnspecified``
    * ``PublishEncryption``
    * ``PublishSigning``
    * ``DoNotPublish``

``filepath``
 Filename and path to local SP certificate, only to be used in testing.

``storeName``
 Store name when to be used with certificate store, ex. My

``storeLocation``
 Store name when to be used with certificate store, ex. LocalMachine

``x509FindType``
 Type to find the X509 certificate in store ex. FindByThumbprint. 

 Allows for System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509FindTypes enum.

``findValue``
 The value to be find according to the x509FindType.
